# Experiment 17
# Aim
to implement stack implementation using array

# Apparatus 
Vs Code

# Theory 
* Stack is a linear data structure which follows LIFO principle. In this article, we will learn how to implement Stack using Arrays.
* In Array-based approach, all stack-related operations are executed using arrays. Letâ€™s see how we can implement each operation on the stack utilizing the Array Data Structure.
* Push
The operation of adding an element to the top of the stack.
Example: If you push 5 onto an empty stack, the stack now contains [5].
* Pop
The operation of removing the top element from the stack.
Example: If you pop from a stack containing [5, 10], it removes 10 and leaves [5].
*Peek (or Top)
A function that returns the top element of the stack without removing it. This operation is not included in the initial implementation but is commonly used.
*Display
The operation to show all elements currently in the stack.
